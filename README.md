Only Compatible with ESX Legacy

You need to change esx function to compatible with ESX 1.1 or 1.2

fix minimap issue, gps issue, esx_status function and very optimized. `0.01 idle and 0.03 in vehicle`

For pna-voice compatible, you just need to put this in `pma-voice/client/main line 201` or inside +cycleproximity command

`exports['joehud']:Voicelevel(voiceMode)`
